  "readme": "# Sticky session\n\nA simple performant way to use [socket.io](http://socket.io/) with a\n[cluster](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install sticky-session\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar sticky = require('sticky-session');\n\nvar server = require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {\n  res.end('worker: ' + process.env.NODE_WORKER_ID);\n});\n\nif (sticky.listen(server, 3000)) {\n  // Master code\n  server.once('listening', function() {\n    console.log('server started on 3000 port');\n  });\n} else {\n  // Worker code\n}\n```\nSimple\n\n## Reasoning\n\nSocket.io is doing multiple requests to perform handshake and establish\nconnection with a client. With a `cluster` those requests may arrive to\ndifferent workers, which will break handshake protocol.\n\nSticky-sessions module is balancing requests using their IP address. Thus\nclient will always connect to same worker server, and socket.io will work as\nexpected, but on multiple processes!\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
